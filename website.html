    <p>Websites are just databases masquerading in pretty masks of design and data post-processing. This thought is what captured my attention and I have since become intrigued at how far you can take the idea. Traditionally, websites were used as simple stores of knowledge. But it doesn’t really have to be this way. With the advent of sites like Yelp and Airbnb, websites, discontent with remaining a glorified library, are now offering services rather than just information. Fascinated with the direction websites are heading I learnt Ruby on Rails, HTML and CSS in order to explore my own ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
    Further projects I am looking at undertaking are similarly customer facing. I would like to create websites that finds the nearest shops with the greatest discounts/deals and design a productivity website that tracks your activities and awards you point based on the number of tasks you complete… kind of like a leveling and quest system in a mmo game. Although the base idea and architecture of a website is relatively straightforward, there are so many things that you could do with it and so many ideas left unexplored or poorly executed. I love to create and am excited at the all the possible prospects.

      A project create using Ruby on Rails where we designed and created a web application similar to stubhub where we plan to allow for events to hold safe transactions without the current overhead and hassle that goes into planning and executing an event using the current stubhub and ticketmaster.
        Currently, the site has a functioning and secure payment system, registration and ticketing system.

      <p>
        The biggest reason we decided to focus on this product is the ones on the market already have an exorbitant "convenience fee".

      <p> The daily californian is one of the oldest newspaper in the entire west coast and one of the oldest college newspaper in the U.S. We are an independent, student-run newspaper that serves the University of California, Berkeley campus and its surrounding community. Our circulation is more than 10,000 for a campus of roughly 40,000 students. Personally I am currently a webdeveloper working on backend/frontend and security for the Daily Cal website, which like most of the items on my website you can access by clicking the image.

      <p> This project was my first exploration into building  an app-like website using ruby. Throughout this project I created a PokePortal, a mysterious realm where I implemented the ability to, catch Pokemon, view Pokemon, view other trainers' Pokemon, damage and destroy other trainers' Pokemon, and finally create a new Pokemon. Link is unavailable until the app is deployed to heroku
