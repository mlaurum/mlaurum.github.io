    <p> I initially got into computer science because I was enthralled by the digital worlds brought about by the advent of games such as Skyrim and Borderlands. I wanted to create a world and share it with people around the globe. Coming to college as a computer science major, I looked to follow in the steps of the developers and worked to design and craft video games with my peers. In addition to wanting to develop games, I also found a passion in analyzing data. I found myself applying this skill set to the realm of video games, performing analysis on video game trends and most recently simulating the Overwatch ranked system. Video games, or more specifically the world and lore inherent in these games, has always had a special place in my heart. Whether it’s exploring hidden dungeons, fighting raid bosses for loot or desigining a pokemon mini-game online, I look forward to see what I’ll do.

      <p> I coordinated and cooperated with six other people to build a virtual reality multiplayer tank game. While I was developing for this project I was in charge of building the net code section. To do this we utilized Unity's available networking engine in order to build a peer to peer system so that the person driving the tank could interact with the person it. In addition to the network infrastrucutre I also worked on coding various features in the tank, such as the tanks hatch, the periscope and also the spawning system. Throughout this project I designed a novel user experience for people to interact with tanks inside virtual reality. We presented this project to renowned companies like PlayStation, Unity and NVidia. If you click on the picture it will direct you to the projects most up to date website.</p>

      <p> I am currently working as a game developer for a private server called Tales of Victoria. The initial copy of this server had been one of the most popular private servers of the mmorpg Maple Story. Now, the server is undergoing a complete rework and is being released under a new name. My main role in this project is to code the interactions between the npc's and player character. The project is written in c# and involves working intricately with the current engines networking code and also utiliazing the data strucutures used to store all of the games assets. Clicking on the picture will take you to a video of the server.</p>

      <p> This was an investigation using pandas and the berkeley data science library. The goal of this project was to analyze basic video game sales trend in relation to the relative economic wealth of a country. The investigation incorporates examples of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals and simulations. The current analysis was presented to the head of the computer science departement Proffesor John Denero. </p>
