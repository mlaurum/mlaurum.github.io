    <p> My name is Mike Lee. A junior computer science major at UC Berkeley. I started computer science because I was enamored at the idea of creating. To craft products other people enjoy. Ideally, design something that transforms the routine. In practice, these lofty goals have translated to me taking interest in various clubs, classes and research projects. Stemming from my initial goal of creation, I joined Virtual Reality at Berkeley. I worked to create a novel user experience in "Landships!", a virtual reality mulitiplayer tank game where people could interact a fully functional tanks. In addition to exploring virtual reality, I worked and am still working with the Berkeley Institue of Data Science in order to help change the way medicine looks at newly developed technologies. More specifically, I am currently using convolutional neural nets to identify tumors segments in mri images. Furthermore these goals have shaped my path in my time at Berkeley, ranging from taking a software engineering class where we designed our own operating systems to data mining classes where we explored how to mold, proccess and magick data to scry coveted answers.

      <p> I coordinated and cooperated with six other people to build a virtual reality multiplayer tank game. While I was developing for this project I was in charge of building the net code section. To do this we utilized Unity's available networking engine in order to build a peer to peer system so that the person driving the tank could interact with the person it. In addition to the network infrastrucutre I also worked on coding various features in the tank, such as the tanks hatch, the periscope and also the spawning system. Throughout this project I designed a novel user experience for people to interact with tanks inside virtual reality. We presented this project to renowned companies like PlayStation, Unity and NVidia. If you click on the picture it will direct you to the projects most up to date website.</p>

      <p> I am currently working as a game developer for a private server called Tales of Victoria. The initial copy of this server had been one of the most popular private servers of the mmorpg Maple Story. Now, the server is undergoing a complete rework and is being released under a new name. My main role in this project is to code the interactions between the npc's and player character. The project is written in c# and involves working intricately with the current engines networking code and also utiliazing the data strucutures used to store all of the games assets. Clicking on the picture will take you to a video of the server.</p>
