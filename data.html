 I have always wanted to learn more about the world, to discover the many secrets hiding just beneath the surface of everyday life. To understand how and why the normality we perceive is the way it is. Towards the end of my sophomore year, I had the pleasure of taking a course on data manipulation and realised that I really enjoyed using data to answer questions about my interests. </p>
 <p>

From there I decided to take on multiple project where I looked at the relationship between the death penalty in various states and their respective crime rates, built a classifier that identified whether a movie was more action or romance and even used a recurrent neural networks trained on the google news corpus in order to predict the next word in a sentence. Recently I have been heavily involved as an undergraduate researcher at the Berkeley Institute of Data science where we develop and train convolutional neural networks on MRI images in order to assist doctors with cancer diagnosis. Ultimately, I am a cs major because I enjoy exploring the way we interact with technology. But I am also a scientist at heart, curious about what secrets the world hides.

      <p> I am currently working with various post-docs and Phd students to research MRI segmentation for tumor detection. We mainly use tensor flow for the training and NiftyNet as the base architecture for our own models. Currently we are researching various other deep learning methods, optimizing for dice score, to see if they provide more insight into our problem. We will enter the Brats imaging competition with the long term goal of presenting at Miccai 2019. The image will take you to the competition page.

      <p>  In this project I used a word2vec library in python called gensim. Using this library, which I trained on the google corpus, I explored word vectors, their similarity, and came up with analogies in order to test my hypothesis regarding the space of words. In addition I chose two datasets, Brown's movie corpus and Google's News corpus to train a skip-gram model from scratch and generate some expected analogies and other vector arithmetic in that space. In addition using the results of this I applied dimensionality reduction techniques using T-sne in order to create a clustering of words.</p><br>

      <p> This is my most recent data engineering project. I am currently working with 2 other Masters Berkeley student in order to use machine learning to analyze a NBA data set containing all match data from the 2015 seasons. We are currently taking multiple approaches to handling the data, using a knn algorithm for pre-processing in order to classify and segment the court. One approach we are taking is a bag of words model to the data. We are currently training a Recurrent Neural Network in order to predict whether a sequence of plays results in a goal or miss. We plan to use this to answer questions such as "Given the defensive plan, what is the best play for the offense to maximize the probability of scoring?""    </p><br>
